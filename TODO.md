### TODO:
- Ability to shift reference tone (eg, A4 = 440), then work fwd & back.
- How to use embedded in Arduino to set oscillator freqs? 
- function `find_harmonies` (calculate ratios present from list)
- function `find_melodies` (based on ratios present, compare to melodies)
- Separate into modules for system gen vs harmonic analysis
