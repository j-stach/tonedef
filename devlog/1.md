Day 1 (5/13/24) of studying music theory. <br>

I can wrap my head around the matter of ratios and frequencies,
but haven't yet taken a deep dive into music in the pythagorean sense.
I've also wanted to make music for a long time. 
I played percussion in high school and had an amateur DJ phase in college,
but was never serious enough about learning an instrument to pick up the
skill. Perhaps I was also unwilling to commit time into a hobby where the 
best I could aspire to was mediocrity.<br>

As I experiment more with electronics as part of my other pursuits, 
I am more and more tempted to build a synthesizer, and through it learn
about music from the ground up.<br>
It would also stoke my ego if I were to master an instrument that I design
and create myself, and so if the time investment is to be considered
worthy, it must be as expressively versatile as I can manage. <br>
In other words, I am going full "Tom" on this one. <br>

My current (and most likely future) favorite band is King Gizzard and the 
Lizard Wizard, and I will tell everyone who hasn't asked exactly how 
great they are. One of my favorite things about them is how well they 
use microtonal and non-Western tunings in some of their albums, and the 
uncanny-yet-beautiful emotions their strange melodies elicit. <br>

Another band I enjoy is Animal Collective, of whose discography 
I have to say my personal favorite is *Feels* (2005). 
According to legend, the instruments used on the album were deliberately 
de-tuned to match an out-of-tune piano the band found in a friend's attic.
It evoke an innocence, nostalgia, and mystery that I haven't heard 
anywhere else, and haven't felt since childhood. <br>

I wonder if I can make an instrument that can capture the hidden emotions 
that are missing from or obscure to Western music. <br>

To do that, I have to get the breakdown of how all of this works,
find some rules for how harmonies can be calculated,
and create a script that can tune a synthesizer to a variety of systems.
<br>

## Notes
Knowing the ratio of the harmonic (2:1 octave, 3:1 tritave) and the EDO 
division, can a list of possible freq-ratios/tone-harmonies be factored? 

To compare 2, 12 with 3, 16, (which is 2, 3-2-2 vs 3, 2-2-2-2);
is a 3:2 perfect 5th possible, or only approximal in 3, 16? <br>
According to the script, the 5th note of the tritave is exactly 1.5 times
times the first. (+4 ~((semi?)tones?)~ steps up.) <br>
But why is this the case, mathematically? <br>

There is no perfect 4th (4:3); 1.33 times 20 is 26.66, and the nearest
tones are 25 and 27.5, a 1.25 (5:4) and 1.375 (11:8) ratio. (+2 & +3) <br>
5:4 is a major 3rd, and 11:8... ??? may be undefined.

+1 step is the whole tone (9:8), a ratio of 1.125, which is fascinating.
There does not seem to be a minor tone (10:9) or a minor third (6:5),
which makes me wonder if 3-tave, 16 edo omits minor intervals and
only includes major intervals. <br>

What impact should that have on the sound? <br>
(And what is 11:8, then? A "Supermajor" interval?) <br>

Here's what GPT had to say about each of the intervals:
```
+0  1:1     Unity (sounds nice)
+1  9:8     Whole step (neutral progress)
+2  5:4     Major 3rd (bright & optimistic)
+3  11:8    "Undecimal major third" (tension? ambiguity?)*
+4  3:2     Perfect 5th (powerful, stable, resolved)
+5  13:8    "Tridecimal major third" (tension? ambiguity?)*
+6  7:4     Septimal tritone (unsettled? unresolved?)*
+7  15:8    Major 7th (expressive, instrospective, longing)
+8  2:1     Octave (prediction: "comfort, stability")
+9  17:8    "Septendecimal whole tone" (???)*
+10 9:4     Major 6th (hope, joy, tenderness)
+11 19:8    "Septendecimal major seventh" (???)*
+12 5:2     "Major third plus an octave" (major third + octave)    
+13 21:8    "Septimal major seventh" (???)*
+14 11:4    "Undecimal major sixth" (???)*
+15 23:8    "Septendecimal tridecimal" (???)*
+16 3:1     Perfect twelfth (grandeur, resolution, finality)
```
Seems like an interesting tuning to explore. <br>

An initial observation is the synchronicity of the conventional names to
the note order (eg, "major 3rd is the 3rd note, prefect 5th is the 5th, 
but that's reasonable since the system only has whole steps.

The "-decimal" intervals seem to be largely unexplored major intervals.

Apparently ratios only hold true relative to the start of the 
harmonic and not within, because it uses equal division (EDO), 
not equal-temperament (ET)? <br>
Are the steps and intervals still relevant for higher notes in the octave?
Meaning, does the third note have a major third in the system, or no? <br>
Is the deviation acceptable, noticeable?
Should I add logarithmic option? <br>

Other tuning approaches to account for? Other ways of justifying? <br>

Is it possible to have a true ratio, with the logarithms factoring out,
or are these all approximations? <br>

To be determined.

### Some more questions to consider
Is a chord a collection of notes with a unique factorization
of the ratios between the pairs of tones in the chord?
How do these ratios translate to emotional effect? Is there a rule?
What is harmonic and disharmonic in this context?

How does the ear judge when an approximal tone sounds pleasant?
Is it better to pull entirely away from approximations, the way (3, 16) 
does for the perfect 4th, so that the ear doesn't expect the 4th?

Is there a combination of ntave and edo that permits all ratios 
from all musical traditions globally?
Up to what point is that reasonable to attempt?
