local harmonies = {
    (2, 1), -- Octave
    (3, 2), -- Perfect fifth
    (4, 3), -- Perfect fourth
    (5, 4), -- Major third
    -- And so on
}

-- How to analyze intervals to determine the possibility of these ratios?

function identify_harmonies(ntave, edo)
    -- determine what the frequency ratio is for each combination
    -- can it be factored?
    -- ntave will automatically be included, so ntave:1 is always a ratio
end

-- knowing the ratio of the ntave and the edo division, 
-- can a list of possible freq-ratios/tone-harmonies be factored 
--
-- is a chord just a collection of notes with a unique factorization
-- of the ratios between the pairs of tones in the chord?


-- to compare 2, 12 with 3, 16,
-- 2, 3*2*2 vs 3, 2*2*2*2
-- is a 3:2 perfect 5th possible, or only approximal in 3, 16?


-- consider:
-- how does the ear judge when an approximal tone sounds pleasant?
